# SKETCH AN ALGORITHM TO SOLVE ANY MAZE

1. EXPLORE ANY DIRECTION THAT ISNT BLOCKED BY A WALL

2. MAINTAIN A LIST WITH ALREADY VISITED CELLS AND ITS PARENT CELL

3. IF THERE ARE NO NEW CELLS TO EXPLORE FROM THE CURRENT POSITION 
  - CHECK IF YOU HAVE SOLVED THE MAZE
  - IF NOT, GO BACK TO THE PARENT CELL UNTIL A NEW NEIGHBOR CELL APPEARS AND GO THAT DIRECTION
  - REPEAT UNTIL YOU SOLVED THE MAZE
